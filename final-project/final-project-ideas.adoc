= CS50 Final Project Ideas

== Jammadoro -- Jamming to tunes while doing Pomodoros

* Web app with a simple Pomodoro timer with work time, short break time, & the
  # of Pomodoros to count
** count down time in large font
** play different noises for work, break, & session stop
** integrate with Spotify by:
*** checking for open players
*** if found, playing during work time & not break time
** store settings on server
*** work time
*** break time
*** default number of Pomodoros
*** Spotify credentials?
*** where user is in session in case interrupted?

* tech detes:
** read Spotify key from server as per C$50 Finance
** make regular updates to DB as time ellapses -- e.g., create PUT endpoint for
   updating in progress time field, send update every 10 seconds?

* Pros:
** Quite useful
** API exposure
** Web exposure
** Limited/realistic scope
** DB exposure

* Cons:
** Not as CS-heavy?

* *q:* all client = use TS, Sass, etc.
** client-server = more vanilla?
** *both* compatible with API -- slight differences in implementation for
   securing

== Do Toos

* Web app

* TODOs on steroids: create tasks, share them with other users, track
  completion rates, re-assign as needed
** Helps manage a home more easily: actually useful
** Assign tasks to "`areas`" that help divy up the workload
** Leverage Google & Outlook calendar APIs

* Pros:
** Web XP
** Useful to career in Web IRL
** Easily shareable portfolio piece
** API XP

* Cons:
** More design/product xp necessary to make impressive portfolio piece
** Lots of design work required before happy with it
** Design work useful but distracting for purposes of course

== Al Gore Rhythms

* Console App

* CLI app written in C & Python to compare the time it takes to complete common
  algorithms between languages
** Write common algorithms in C, Python, & others going forward
** Accept a single list of numbers from the user
*** Validate numbers contain only valid digits, separated by whitespace
** "`Dispatch`" these algorithms while timing them
** Write results to console in textual format
*** Eventually, can represent graphically, either through CLI app lib or
    web-based one (using Wasm?)
** Name = compare perf to be least wasteful from computing? Fun idea?

* Pros:
** Good portfolio piece
*** Can add to over time with different algorithms, data structures, &
    frameworks – valuable learning XP
** Exposure to CS/algorithms & data structures?
** Very little design work required
** Interesting – can keep adding other languages/platforms for experimentation
   & explore other algorithms

* Cons:
** Not easily shareable unless go with Wasm (out of scope probably?)
*** _Maybe not relevant? Can just share GitHub?_
** Not as applicable to web career

== **CLI**ppy

* A library of common Unix utilities

* Re-make the most common CLI tools for a Unix environment in C
** Learning experience for writing low-level system code
** Find source code for GNU-based equivalents & compare approaches in writeup?
** Most common = `+ls+`, `+cat+`, `+grep+`, `+cd+`
*** `+cd+` = shell builtin?
** *Or* should just pick 1 & try to recreate all it’s args, features, etc.?
** *Or* pick 1 & provide most useful options for it?
*** Ex., `+ls+` = list normally, list all, list long?

* Pros:
** Good learning XP for low-level systems programming
** Interesting to compare with real code for learning purposes
** Good portfolio piece?
** Very applicable to course code?

* Cons:
** Lots of time?
** Beyond skill level?

== Crash -- The **Cra**sh-prone **Sh**ell

* Make a basic shell coded in C
** Read from $PATH?
** Dispatch C programs?
** Include several built-ins?

* Pros:
** Good XP?
** Fun project to maintain/add to over time?
** Add useful features – built-in package manager for prompts?
*** Bundle with Oh My Posh?

* Cons:
** Lots of time?
** Beyond skill level?
