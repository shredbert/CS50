= CS50 Final Project: Jammadoro

== Intro

* Web app with a simple Pomodoro timer with work time, break time, & the
  # of Pomodoros to count
** count down time in large font
** play different noises for work, break, & session stop
** integrate with Spotify by:
*** checking for open players
*** if found, playing during work time & not break time
** store settings on server
*** work time
*** break time
*** default number of Pomodoros
*** Spotify credentials?
*** where user is in session in case interrupted?

== Product Requirements

* home = view & set work time & # of Pomodoros to count in a row
** create account to store preferences & view dashboard

* allow for login to Spotify
** select from playlists in lib to listen to
** toggle play/pause if app open
** display which app being played in
** *persist* login if logged into app?

* dashboard = display:
** total length of time using app
** avg Pomodoros per month, day, week
** *top playlists/songs* while Pomodoros active?!?!

* sign in = integrate with Google & MS?
** good xp w/ APIs?

== Technical Requirements

* TODO: how to store where at in timer session? regularly update server?
  necessary?

* timer itself = pretty simple, mostly client logic
** separate page for configs -- stores in Postgres

* use Flask for server

* use Flask-Session for storing user's state

* contact Spotify API
** use "requests" package

* use Postgres instead of SQLite & connect via SQLAlchemy
** requires more Python packages -- check which ones

* deploy to Digital Ocean
** run DB on server itself, *not* separately
