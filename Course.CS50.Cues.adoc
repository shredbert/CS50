== Lecture 0: Scratch

* what lang. do comps. use to interpret instructions from ppl?
** why do they use this lang.?
** what physical components do comps. use to represent info?

* what agreed-upon system is used to translate *keyboard characters* into info
  comps. can understand?
** how many chars. does this system provide?
*** how are they numbered?
** what subsequent char. encoding system is used to expand the number of
   available chars for comps.?
*** what are the benefits of this subsequent systems?
** what *child's game* is analogous to how comps. represent videos?

* what *3 steps* are required for a comp. to solve problems?

* what are algorithms?
** what *2 traits* do good algorithms have?
** why are these traits important?

* what *real-world* algorithm would you use to find a name in a phonebook
  *correctly*?
** what could you do to make this algorithm *more efficient* while also *still
   correct & precise*?
** what *2 dimensions/axes* do all algorithms exist on?
** what is a *bug*?
** what is *pseduo-code* & why is it important?

== Lecture 1: C

* what 3 principles are behind writing good code?

* what is a terminal?
** what is an IDE & what does it stand for?
** what is a *terminal prompt* & what does it look like (in this course...)?

* who is *computer code* written for, & do comps. understand it?

* what is a compiler?
** what is 1 example of program in this course that *compiles C code?*
** how do you run an executable (or binary) file from the command line?

* what are *functions?*
** what are *arguments?*
** what is 1 example of a *C function* we're using in this course?

* what *2 things* do all comp. programs do?
** which one of produces the info we see in the programs we create?
** do all values returned by programs *need to be displayed to the user?*

* what is a *library* in code?

* what *5 things* are necessary to *create & assign* variables in C?
** name *each part* in the example below
** which side of the *assignment operator* is executed by the comp. 1^st^?
+
----
string name = "bert";
----

* in the following example, identify & explain the following:
. string placeholder
. escape character
** _*bonus:* what are *escape characters* & what does the one in this example
   do?_
. function arguments
+
[source, C]
----
string name = "bert";
printf("Heya%s!!!\n", name);`
----

* what is an example of the *boilerplate code* required to write a C program?

* what are *header files* in C?

* what 3 CS50 course utilities are available to provide help with assignments
  in the terminal?

* if you *open a binary/executable file* in a text editor, why does it look so
  strange?

* describe the following *terminal commands & symbols:*
** `ls`
*** _what do green items with asterisks mean?_
** `rm`
*** _what do you type if prompted?_
** `mv`
** `mkdir`
** `cd`
** `~`
** `..`
** `./`
** `pwd`
** `rmdir`
** `cp`
** _*bonus:* which of these can be used to run executable files?_

* what are *datatypes* & what *6 C datatypes* have been discussed so far?
** what are the *format codes* for each that are used by `printf()`?

* what happens if you *divide the ints* in the following example?
** what *technique* can be used to *fix this error* (by converting the
   datatypes)?
** how do you code it?
+
----
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
float z = x / y;
----

* what are *conditional expressions* & *what 3 types* are there?

* what syntax is used to *determine equality?*
** what are the differences between determining *string & char* equality?
** what expression is used to *join 2 equality expressions?*

* of the following *3 types* of loops, which one:
. checks the condition 1^st^ *before* executing a program?
. executes a program & *then* checks a condition?
** _*hint:* this type of loop would be best for getting user input!_
. is used to execute something a *specific number* of times?
** _*hint:* this is the funniest looking one!_
+
----
int i = 0;
do
{
    printf("hey!!!\n");
}
while (i < 50);

while (i < 50)
{
    printf("hey!!!\n");
    i++;
}

for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++)
{
    printf("hey!!!\n");
}
----

* what is *ascii art?*

* what is *abstraction* & how can *functions* be used to accomplish it?

* what does it mean when your terminal says *C99?*

* what is *scope?*
** what *quick rule of thumb* can be used to determine scope?
*** _*hint:* use the braces, doy!_
** in the following example, what *scope-related mistake* would cause the
   compiler to print an error?
+
----
int x = 1;
if (x == 1)
{
    string name = "bert";
}
printf("hey, %s!!!\n", name);
----

* what *limitation* most commonly causes computers to be *imprecise &
  unreliable?*
** what *types of programs* will this impact the most?
