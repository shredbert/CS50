= CS50 Summary

== Lecture 0: Scratch

* programming = solve problems with computers by giving them precise,
  methodical instructions
** input -> algorithm (solve problem) -> output
** need to standardize communication ops so we can interact w/ comps (help them
   understand)

* use binary -> easily communicate w/ comps
** comps use *electricity* to turn *transistors* on or off, which then
   *represent data*
** bit = binary digit (single transistor state), byte = group of 8 binary
   digits/transistors
*** bytes = 256 vals (0 - 255)
** most computers use *bytes* for each piece of info

* binary = base 2
** ######## = 2^7^ + 2^6^ + 2^5^ + 2^4^ + 2^3^ + 2^2^ + 2^1^ + 2^0^ 

* standardized mapping for representing human-lang chars = *ASCII*
** only 256 vals available so expanded over time with *Unicode* (emojis,
   non-english symbols, etc.)
*** unicode = *standard descriptions,* implementation vary slightly

* similar w/ colours -> RGB has 3 bytes, each representing a spectrum
  of colours types
** sim. w/ HSL (hue, saturation, lightness)
** images = groups of colours
** vids = groups of images (flipbook)
** audio = sometimes MIDI

* algorithm = precise instructions for problem-solving
** exist on axis of correctness & efficiency/preciseness/well-designedness
*** efficiency is particularly evident over time as problem gets more complex
** ensure comps *don't misinterpret*
** e.g., contacts app -> flip through 1 pg at a time vs biting off half at a
   time & filtering based on alphabet
** avoid bugs -> unexpected behaviours so give very precise instructions

* pseudocode = problem-solving steps described in human language
** actions (functions), conditions (if/else), booleans (true/false tests for
   conditions), & loops (go back & do `x`)

* abstraction = complicated idea simplified for use by us (e.g., functions can
  *abstract away* ideas)
** helpful when breaking problems into steps -> abstract logic through
   functions

== Lecture 1: C

* the 3 aspects of good code are that it's correct (solves problem),
  well-designed (understandable & efficient), & formatted well (styled)
** *never* sacrifice correctness

* compilers convert source code to machine code
** comps only understand 0s & 1s
** `make` compiles but *isn't* a compiler -> build tool to automate

* functions = action to execute, arguments = inputs to execute action
** functions -> 1^st^ the return datatype, then the arg datatype(s)
*** use to abstract away implementation detes
*** need to add prototypes for funcs
*** header files contain *only prototypes*
*** `math.h` = std lib w/ func for rounding nums
** side effect = change that can be *observed*
*** return vals = stored for later

* import libraries to reuse other code
** use `#include <[path]>` in C to include `.h` files -> like a *menu* of
   options

* variable types all take up different amounts of memory (i.e., diff. #s of
  *bytes*)
** data types -> chars & strings, bools, ints & longs, floats & doubles
** `printf()` placeholders -> `%c`, `%s`, `%i` (bools & ints?), `%li`, `%f`
   (floats & doubles?)
** need to *cast* to operate on diff. datatypes
*** e.g., add decimal to 1 int in operation to divide *OR* incorporate
    `(float)`
** `printf()` precision = `"%.50f", n`

* *don't* assign val to var unless reusing later
** *consts should be capital case in C*

* all data types have some memory constraints that impact programming decisions
** ints have ++~++4 bill vals *but* positive & negative so really ++~++2 bill
   each way

* with conditions, good to use `else { }` at end -> often don't need to be
  verbose with final condition if all others accounted for
** when comparing chars, use `'a'`, not `"a"`

* tell even/odd using `n % 2 == 0` operator

* `while ()` = loop if condition true
** `do while ()` = get input
** `for ()` = counter shorthand

* C99 = 1999 version of C

* *scope* -> vars only available in the braces (`{ }`) where they've been
  declared

* comps *imprecise* -> store closest possible val but *can't* rep all real nums
  (esp. w/ ints)
** *floating-point imprecision* = decimals
*** big deal in finance & math
** *integer overflow* = whole nums
*** reason behing Y2K & upcoming date issues (2038) -- 32-bit ints tracking
    time will be truncated over time, meaning they will start defaulting to the
    lowest ints possible, therefore indicating all dates are sometime in
    ++~++1901

== Lecture 2: Arrays

* `make` = *build tool,* automates use of `clang` (in course)
** good cus don't have to link libs, customize output name, or specify source
** default filename = `a.out` (assembler out)
** *note:* `stdio` linked automatically by `clang`, other libs not so much

* "compiling" really 4 steps:
. preprocessing -- look up prototypes for linked libs
. compiling -- convert to assembly lang
*** assembly = lowest-level code humans can read, maps easily to machine code
    instructions for CPU
. assembling -- convert assembly to machine code
. linking -- join lib machine code into single executable

* 3 approaches to debugging:
. use print statements to read values of interest
. use debugger -- set breakpoints to pause execution at, play to execute, step
  over to execute line-by-line, step into to see functions, & see vals of all
  vars in VSCode
*** `debug50` -> starts VSCode debugger?
. rubber ducking -- explain logic step-by-step as tho someone is there (but
  really just to inanimate object)

* each datatype has diff. memory:
** char & bools = 1 byte (8-bit)
*** bools *could* be just 1 bit (0 or 1) but langs don't usually go that
    low-level
** int & float = 4 bytes (32-bit)
** long & double = (64-bit)
** string = indeterminate, depends
** *RAM* = random access memory
*** place where data in vars stored, like grid of squares with each square = 1
    byte
** for greater precision, *cast* ints to floats
*** implicit = convert 1 num to decimal (easiest)
*** overt = use `(float)` on all ints
*** *or* use `printf()` & placeholder symbols for chars
**** cast to ints using placeholder symbols (i.e., `%c` or `%i`)

* arrays = vars that can store multiple of same datatype
** cleaner code -> no repeating arbitrary var names
** access values through *index* -> zero-counting
** for loops = designed for, counters lend selves to index

* strings = *arrays* of chars
** always *1 extra byte* -> need NUL char to end (`\0`), else never know where
   1 string ends & other begins
** count non-NUL w/ `string.h` -> `strlen()` or manually by iterating through
** convert case -> lowercase to upper = `-32`, uppercase to lower = `+32`
** check case w/ *single quotes* -> `if (var[i] >= ++'++a++'++ || var[i] <=
    ++'++z++'++) { }`
** or convert/check w/ `ctype.h` -> `toupper()`, `islower()`
** `get_string()` uses *dynamic memory allocation* to grow/shrink size of var
  automatically

* `int main (int argc, string argv[]) { }`
** `argc` = *argument count*
** `argv[]` = *argument vector*, array of CLI args
*** always at least 1 -> `[0]` = cmd name
** `main` *always* returns exit status -> `0` for no error, `1` or more for
   exit
*** returns `0` by default but *explicitness good*

* cryptography = art of scrambling info, encryption = process of scrambling
** steps:
. inputs
.. plaintext = source to scramble
.. key = number of chars to scramble away from
. cipher = algorithm for scrambling
. ciphertext = scrambled output
** caesar cipher = add 1
