== Course Notes

=== C

* C = computer lang, new syntax & more precision than Scratch

* 3 aspects of good code:
** correctness (solves problem)
** design (well-written == understandable & efficient)
** style (visual formatting)

=== IDEs, compilers, interfaces

* compiler = convert code bt langs
** in this case, C code (source) to machine code (0s & 1s)

* CLI = command-line interface w/ direct access to OS
** compile w/ `make hello` (creates file)
** run w/ `./hello`
*** current folder -> `.`, specify files in folder w/ `/[filename]`
** delete w/ `rm [filename]` & respond w/ `y`
** view w/ `ls` (list)
*** files w/ `*` & green text *executable*
** *recompile* when changing

* make *not* a compiler -> finds file, compiles, & names automatically
** handy-dandy build tool

=== Functions, arguments, return vals, vars

* functions = actions, args = inputs
** `printf()`

* side effect = change that can be observed
** arg -> function -> side effect

* return vals -> save into var, don't output
** single `=` -> *assignment* operator, not equality
** variable types dictate how programs *handle different bytes*

* many tools (compilers) written long ago -> errors concise due to constraints
  so not user-friendly

* escape sequence -> pass special symbol to string, like `\n` (new line)
** begin with `\`

* library = reusable extensions to code
** `#include <[libName].h>` in C

* `printf()` accepts *placeholder* to print vars -> also var as 2^nd^ arg
** `printf("print %s\n", var);`

=== main, header files, commands

* `main { }` in C = entry point, begins execution from top-down

* header files (`fn.h`) are *menus* of functions linked
** implementation files are `fn.c` -> separate

* common Linux commands:
** `cd` = change dir
** `ls` = list contents
** `cp` = copy
** `rm` = remove (file)
** `rmdir` = remove dir
** `mkdir` = make dir
** `mv` = move (file or dir)

* can pass commands to editor (VSCode) -> `code [filename]` to create/open
  files

* move backwards with `../` -> `..` = *parent* directory (above)

* run files with `./[filename]` -> `.` = current directory

=== Types, format codes, operators

* data types indicate what data represented by vars -- commonly:
** char = 1 character ("1", "a", "X", etc.)
** string = multi characters
** bool = true/false (or 1/0 depending on lang)
** int = nums without decimals
** long = ints that go higher
** float = nums with decimals
** double = floats that go higher
** CS50 library has `get_[datatype]()` helper functions for assignments ->
   makes getting input easier

* `printf()` placeholders *change* for each type:
** `%c` = chars
** `%s` = strings
** `%i` = ints
** `%li` = long ints
** `%f` = floats *&* doubles

* comps. do lots of math:
** `*` = multiply
** `/` = divide
** `+` = add
** `-` = subtract
** `%` = divide but return *remainder* (modulus = nerd term)

=== Variables, syntactic sugar

* declare var with `[type] [name];`
** can also *assign* during declaration with `[type] [name] = [val];`
** *or* assign *after* declaring with just `[name] = [val];` (*don't* declare
   more than once)

* syntactic sugar = shorthands for common operations
** e.g., add 1 to var:
+
[source,c++]
----
int num = 1;
num = num + 1; // add 1 to num
num += 1; // also add 1 to num
num++; // also also add 1 to num
----

=== Calculations

* var names should be semantic
** *but* algebra-style OK with just math (e.g., `x`, `y`)

* can assign anything to var (e.g., output of calculations)
** *however,* don't bother if *not re-using* -> waste of space

* comments = remind what code does & how
** start line comments with `//` in C
** put multi-line comments between `/* */` in C

* terminal hacks:
** tab completion -> start command (e.g., `make h`) & tab will finish (`make
   hello`)
** up/down arrows = go to previous/next commands in history

* each data type has fixed # of bits for vals -> e.g., int = 32-bits (++~++4
  billion vals)
** *but* positive & negative, which means an int can be ++~++-2 bill to ++~++2
   bill
** longs help store more than ints but still have limitations due to memory
   constraints

=== Conditionals, Boolean expressions

* `if ()`, `else ()`, & `else if()` -> conditionals, *not* functions
** i.e., *don't* need `;`

* `==` -> *compare* 2 values for equality
** use `else` to finish conditionals -> simpler when *prev* conditions rule out
   any other possibilities
+
[source,c++]
----
if (x < y)
{
    printf("x is less than y\n");
}
else if (x > y)
{
    printf("x is greater than y\n");
}
else
{
    printf("x is equal to y\n");
}
----

* *magic numbers* -> values that come from somewhere unknown
** e.g., randomly hard-coding to a val
** declare vals like these with constants (i.e., don't change) -> `const in
   NAME = 1`
*** capital case naming = *convention for consts in C*

* good use-case for `%` (remainder/modulus) -> `if (n % 2 == 0)` means
  something's an even number

* *or* operator -> `if (x == "y" || x == "Y")`

* *and* operator -> `if (x == "y" && y == "y")`

=== Loops, functions

* `while (condition) { }` -> loop forever while *condition true*
** e.g., counters:
+
[source,c++]
----
int i = 0;
while (i < 3)
{
    printf("%i\n", i);
    i++;
}
----
*** `i` = common var name for counters
** so common that there's a dedicated loop *just* for counting:
+
[source,c++]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    printf("meow\n");
}
----
*** only diff. from `while()` loop is that `i` is *only available inside
    braces* (i.e., for loop vars *scoped* to inside the loop)

* create own functions with:
+
[source,c++]
----
void doSomething(void)
{
    // code here -- runs every time called
}
----
** 1^st^ `void` = don't *return* anything, 2^nd^ void = don't accept
   *arguments*
** functions must be *declared* so compilers know what's up -> use *prototype*
[source,c++]
----
void doSomething(void); // place at start of code

int main(void)
{
    // entry-point here
}

void doSomething(void)
{
    // function code here
}
----
*** *header* files (`.h`) contain *only prototypes,* while their corresponding
    *library* files (`.c`) contain the functions themselves

=== Mario

* best way to get user input is with a `do { } while ();` loop
+
[source,c++]
----
int n;
do
{
    n = get_int("Width: ");
}
while (n < 1);
----
** i.e., does something, *then* checks condition

* *nested* loops -> good for ASCII art (i.e., Mario problem)
+
[source,c++]
----
// For each row
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    // For each column
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
        // Print a brick
        printf("#");
    }

    // Move to next row
    printf("\n");
}   
----

* stop loops early with `break;` statements
+
[source,c++]
----
while (true)
{
    n = get_int("Size: ");
    if (n > 1)
    {
        break;
    }
}
----

=== Imprecision, overflow

* when printing floats or doubles with `printf()`, can specify *precision*
  (i.e., # of decimal places)
** `printf("%.50f\n", z);`

* *floating-point imprecision* -> comps can't represent all possible real
  numbers with a finite number of bits
** e.g., 32 bits for a `float` -> not big enough
** comps store closest val possible, making it *imprecise*

* similar problem with *integer overflow* -> not having enough memory means
  line of numbers will be truncated
** e.g., `111` + 1 = `1000`, but gets trimmed to just `000`

* Y2K -> dates stored with years as just `98`, `99`, etc. -> year 2000 created
  confusion (`00` = 1900 or 2000?)
** similar issue now -> 2038 means all the 32-bit ints tracking time will be
   obsolete
*** i.e., when we hit max # of ints & they start being truncated, the
    *negative* symbol for the int will start being added, meaning all ints will
    be assumed to be the *lowest possible value*
*** therefore, the lowest ints will all be interpreted as the lowest common
    date, some time in 1901

* `math.h` is a library that allows us to round numbers
+
[source,c++]
----
#include <cs50.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    float amount = get_float("Dollar Amount: ");
    int pennies = round(amount * 100);
    printf("Pennies: %i\n", pennies);
}
----

== Lecture

* programming in C = same ideas as Scratch, just *text-based*
** i.e., *pseudo-code* identical for all problems being solved, just the
   *format for telling the computer how to do it* that changes

* 3 principles for *writing code well:*
. *correctness* (work as intended)
. *design* (subjective, well-written)
** like essays (correct args, poor writing)
. *style* (aesthetic, like good punctuation, caps, indents, etc.)
** don't change *correctness* when improving other 

* CS50 IDE
** IDE = integrated dev environment, env. for programming
** ide.cs50.io -> course-specific, browser-based
** terminal & text editor
*** term = commands

* text editor (edit code) + terminal window (run cmds)
** cloud-based -> ensures everyone has same exp.

* env. requires *CLI*
** not *GUI*
** term = blinking prompt

* *code* understood by humans, *computers* understand binary (1s & 0s)
** comps. can print on screen -> pattern of 0s & 1s
** take source code & convert it to 0s & 1s that comps. understand using a
   *compiler*
** compiler = intermediary program -> cnvrt. src. to machine code
** *make* -> compiler
*** *no* file extension
** run with ./hello -> no extension, bin. output has none
*** "$" -> *prompt* (where commands are typed)

* funcs. & args.
** mini-program -> action/verb
*** "say", "wait", etc.
** inputs = args. (or parameters)
** say something in say = printf()
*** printf = print *formatted*
** Scratch -> white ovals *mimic brackets*
** need semicolon, quotes, brackets, etc.
*** many lines of code need to end with semicolon

* same *paradigm* as scratch
** functions = programmed version of algorithm (implemented in code)

* *programs do 2 things:* takes inputs (args.) & can have *side effects*
*** often *visual* (text/audio)
** return vals./variables -> functions hand back vals. (don't show/say)
*** use output in program
** Scratch -> say block has immediate vis. effect, ask block tucks away stuff
   in var.
** `get_string()` -> from *CS50 library*
*** lib. = code others wrote

* string = *text*
** `get_string("[prompt]")` -> func. with input

* have to *assign* to vars
** e.g., `string answer = get_string("what's your name?");`
*** `=` is *assignment* operator
*** need to tell comp. what *type* of var, too
** `[type] [name] = get_string("[prompt]");`

* forgetting "grammar" makes code *frustrating & not interesting,*
  pedantic/aesthetic
** good style/grammar comes with *practice* (like writing other langs.)

* can then *do something* with return val.
** side effects = happen to you, return val. = info stored so you can use it
** do in C -> `printf("hello, %s", answer);`
*** `%s` = format code, printf() does formatting on placeholders (string in
    this case)
*** commas (outside of quotes) = separate args. to functions (ignore comma *in
    string*)

* more verbose = more readable (e.g., "answer" instead of just "a")
** math doesn't *need* to be semantic -> no style

* C = older, have to recompile every time
** now have fancier envs. where compiles automatically (code.org, codecademy)

* have to *tell* comp. to break line
** i.e., move cursor to next line
** `\[char]` = *escape character*, `\n` = new line

* don't have to *call* get_string(), assigning to var. calls func.
** `=` tells comp. to execute RH & *then* store, spreading 2 ops. in 1

* CS50 lib. -> allows same logic as scratch (`get_string`)

* Boilerplate -- needed to start writing
+
[source,c++]
----
int main(void)
{

}
----

* Header files -> end with `.h`
** `#include <stdio.h>` -> very pop. file in C that gets input/output
*** e.g., `printf()`
** access *more functions* than defaults
** header files = *extensions in Scratch* (fancy buried features)

* many ways to screw up prgs.
** top of output usually gives name of file & where
** *help50* -> prog., helps to make sense of cryptic output in term. by
   translating
** `make hello` = `help50 make hello`

* ugly = bad *style*, hard to read
** no errors with bad style -> use `style50` prg.
** use comments -> good style
*** ensure *semantic* -> purpose of code, not code itself

* `check50` -> tool for labs/assignments to check *correctness* of code
** automated tests from staff
** enter `check50 cs50/problems/hello` -> prompts GitHub auth.
** red = errors, yellow = couldn't run test cus prev. failed, green = tests
   pass

* CS50 IDE = own *server* in cloud

* binary files in text editors -> machine lang., users can't see
** 0s & 1s technically *misinterpreted* in ASCII chars. within *text editor*
** i.e., machine code misinterpreted as text
** open *source code,* not *program*

* term. cmds:
** `ls` -> list files in current directory
*** bash green w/ asterisk = executable
** `rm` -> remove (`rm -rf` for directories with files)
*** `y` or `n` at prompt for yes/no
** `mv` -> rename/move
** `mkdir` -> make dir.
** `cd` -> move to dir.
** `~` -> tilde = *home* directory
** `..` -> prev. dir.
** `./` -> current dir.
*** run files with `./[filename]`
** `pwd` -> print the current dir.
** `rmdir` -> remove dir.
** `cp` -> copy

* `make` = makes *easier* to compile but not *technically* a compiler

* data types -> lots in C
** *type* of val. to store
** also many *funcs.* for CS50 that help you get diff. data types
** some types have *finite bits* -> ints, floats, chars, doubles, longs,
   strings, etc.
*** int = 32 bits, ++~++4 billion
*** long = 64 bits, twice as many vals.
** `printf()` -> diff. format codes, %c (char), %f (float w/ dec), %i (int), %li
   (long int), %s (string)
** *operators* -> +, -, * , /, % 
*** all math stuff -> early nerds

* CS50's `get_int()` -> will reject vals. based on invalid input, like 3 & 4
  bill.
** 2 bill. max (4 bill. *total* but includes *negatives*)

* *float* for decimals -> most division ops.
** *however,* if other vars are ints, won't work (rounds)
** *lose* decimals -> math done on *ints,* no matter what the result is stored
   as
** could change all to floats
** *OR* convert ints to floats -> *casting*
*** `float z = (float) x / (float) y`
*** new datatype in parens. = *casting*

* `=` is assignment operator, RH side 1^st^
** `counter = counter + 1`
** *OR* `counter += 1;` or `counter++;` -> *syntactic sugar*

* conditions:
+
[source,c++]
----
if ([condition])
{
    [logic]
}
else if ([other condition])
{
    [other logic]
}
else
{
    [other other logic]
}
----
** try to *be succinct* -> just use else at end to reduce typing

* equality = `x == y`, less than = `x < y`, greater than = `x > y`

* use *single quotes* when comparing individual characters (*chars*)
** string = `""`, char = `''`
** use `||` for multiple options (`if ([cond1] || [cond2])`)

* looping -> `for()` = specific # of times, `while()` = until condition true
+
[source,c++]
----
// while loops -- check condition *then* do something
int i = 0 // "i" = int, short
while (i < 50)
{
    printf("hey!!!\n");
    i++;
}

// do while -- do 1 thing *before* checking condition
do
{
    printf("hey!!!\n");
}
while (i < 50);

// for loops -- concise when doing something a certain # of times
for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) // unique to for loop -> multiple statements/semi-colons in brackets
{
    printf("hey!!!\n");
}
----

* abstraction = *simplify* complicated detes underneath
** use *functions* to hide complex code
** custom funcs. usually at *bottom* (main/entry point at top)
** *errors* -> compiler doesn't know where func. is
*** can put *title* at top to tell compiler it *will* exist (`void meow(void);`
    with actual func. at bottom)

* some lines *don't* need semicolons -> function names, for loops, if
  statements, etc.
** *convention* -> finish most constructs with thought, others decided it
   didn't need

* *C99* -> 1999 version of C

* functions -> 1^st^ = rtrn. val. & parens -> *args.*
** `void meow(int n)` = no output, `n` input
** `return` statement -> send value back from func.

* *scope* -> if want var. outside of curly braces, need it *declared* outside
** i.e., lines of code where a var. exists
** *match the braces!!!*
** *don't* need vals just to declare

* what computers *can't* do:
** *finite memory* -> limitation
** `printf()` can print out to lots of digits
*** `printf("%.10f\n", 1 / 10);`
** with lots of decimal places, *incorrect result*
** *memory* issue -> if using finite bits, can count *infinitely
   high/precisely*
*** i.e., *approximates* at some point
*** big deal for math/finance -> imprecision == bad
*** issues with floats *&* ints
*** like y2k
*** will happen in *2038* again -> no more bits to keep track of time, 32-bit
    #s counting seconds from Jan. 1^st^, 1970
*** _4 billionth second will be hit_
