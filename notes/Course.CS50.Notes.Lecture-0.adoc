== Course Notes

=== Welcome

* CS = problem solving, not programming

=== What is computer science?

* precise & methodical = good problem solving
** break down process: take *input* -> do something *(algorithm)* -> produce
   *output*
** how to represent inputs & outputs consistently so computers can understand?

=== Representing numbers

* unary = count w/ fingers as single vals of 1 (1 at a time)

* decimal = higher numbers w/ ten digits

* computers *simpler* -> binary = 0s & 1s

* bit = a single binary digit (unit of 0 or 1)

* computers run on electricity & represent by turning a switch on or off
** comps of billions of switches called *transistors*
** turn on/off to rep vals

* decimal nums -> 123 = (10^2^ * 1) + (10^1^ * 2) + (1 * 3)
** binary same -> 00000111 = (2^2^ * 1) + (2^1^ * 1) + (1 * 1)
*** i.e., 7 in decimal

* most computers process *8 bits at a time* -> `00000011` = 3 in decimal

=== Text

* since comps use nums, *map* nums to letters for comps
** standard mapping decided on by ancestors = *ASCII*
** nums, letters, & basic punctuation
** e.g., A = 65 in decimal, 01000001 in binary
** diff. contexts (i.e., file formats) = different ways to display nums/text

* eight bits = 1 byte = 2^8^/256 diff. vals (255 highest, 0 inclusive)
** kilabytes = 1,000, megabytes = 1,000,000 bytes, giga = 1,000,000,000 etc.

* *unicode* -> expand ASCII to include chars w/ accents, symbols from other
  langs, emojis, etc.
** *descriptions* have been standardized, not images themselves,
*** i.e., diff. software/devices have slightly diff. emojis

=== Images, videos, sounds

* common system for colours = *RGB*
** i.e., 3 bytes, 1 each for R, G, & B
** millions of colours

* pixels -> make up screen so image = pixel with bytes for colour

* vids = series of imgs (flipbook)

* music = MIDI

* *0s & 1s interpreted in ways we dictate*
** some formats use compression (i.e., rep. data with fewer bits via math) or
   containerization (i.e., diff. types joined, .docx files)
** variety of formats -> not all standardized but *standards groups* help build
   consensus (e.g., Unicode Consortium)

=== Algorithms

* problem solving = possible once agreed-upon ins/outs
** algorithm = step-by-step instructions for solving a problem

* e.g., find name in contacts app
** flip through 1 by 1 = *correct* but not efficient
** flip 2 at a time = *incorrect* (might skip)
** flip half at a time & see which half will have name alphabetically = *most
   efficient*
** as # of contacts increase, most efficient solution takes less & less time to
   solve (i.e., efficient = size of problem keep time to solve @ minimum)

=== Pseudocode

* pseudocode = human lang.
** *include* computer-specific instructions like mandatory cases for quitting,
   etc.
** action verbs = *functions*
** if, else, else if = *conditionals*
** where to go = *boolean expressions*
** go back = *loops*
** also vars, return vals, etc. (not gen. pseudo coded)

=== Scratch basics

* coordinate-based system

=== Abstraction

* combine several ideas (in Scratch, puzzle pieces)

* programming = break problem into pieces & solve 1 at time

== Lecture Notes

* prob. solving: input -> ??? -> output

* how rep. inputs? *info*
** representation -> count with hand? (Unary notation)
** count #s (decimal digits = base 10)
*** *compose* #s using digit system

* comps. -> not same lang. as ppl
** *simple* = *binary,* 0s & 1s

* base 2 = other nomenclature = bits (binary digits)
** don't use base 10 -> electricity as physical input
** harness elec. & *rep. as info*
*** on/off -> light switch = info
** electricity = track info (store = 1, let go = 0)

* *problem* -> counting higher than 1
** more bulbs -> binary #s, e.g. 3 bulbs = 8 opts., 111 = 7

* *transistors* -> 1's & 0's that comps. have to rep. info
** comps. -> same system as dec. but with bin.
** 10^0^, 10^1^, 10^2^ -> base 10 digits with numerous #'s
** 2^0^, 2^1^, 2^2^, etc. -> base 2
** 110010 bin = 2 + 8 + 16 = 50 dec

* comps. -> started as calculators
** modern = more sophisticated
** how rep. letters? assign letters to unique #'s
** a = 65 = 01000001
** *context* differs for seeing but info same = ascii
*** i.e., defined mapping of letters to #'s
** 72 73 33 = hi! in ascii (asciichart.com)

* getting msg = pattern of bits
** *8-bits* -> moder std. for representing chars
** patterns of 8-bits (8 0's & 1's) = *bytes* (kilo, giga, terra, etc.)

* ascii = only english symbols & punctuation
** 11111111 = max # of chars, 24-bits total
*** 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255 (256 opts.)
** limiting -> bad rep. of human language (accented chars, entire chars in
   other languages)
** *emojis* -> also not covered, implemented as *0's/1's*
** transition from ascii to *unicode* (support all languages)
** face with tears of joy = most pop. emoji, rep.'d as 128514 in dec.
** *way* more than 256 chars

* electricity, #'s, letters, emojis/other langs., *colour/pics*
** how colours rep.'d in comp. -> #'s to diff. colours, agree on mapping
** rgb, hsl, etc. -> map 0's & 1's to diff. colours
** every colours = blend of #'s
** e.g., 72 73 33 bits in rgb = yellow (emoji colour)
*** _context-specific_
** pixels -> core building blocks of displays, images composed of lots of dots
   (pxs.), each using 24-bits (3 bytes)
*** why binary files so large -> tons of combinations

* comps. rep. vids. similarly -> series of stored images, changing many times
  per second
** _flip book_
** music -> could rep. in diff. ways, nums.? (notes, durations, etc.)
*** music can be quantized -> just need to *agree*
** diff. file formats -> rep. *agreed patterns* of 0's & 1's so can be
   displayed consistently
** all 0's & 1's

* rep. inputs *consistently* to solve probs. & get outputs (conv. to
  solutions)
** nums, chars, imgs., vids., sound
** algorithms = step-by-step instructions for *solving problems*
*** i.e., *recipe* or *instructions* with *no ambiguity* (comps.)
*** _inputs -> algorithms -> outputs_
** *correct & precise* -> comps. take literally
** *translate* algorithm into lang. comp. understands
*** ensure comp. *doesn't* misinterpret

* algorithm -> contacts app
** store alphabetically
** old-school -> phonebook
** look through 1 page @ a time -> *correct,* not *efficient*
*** skipping pgs. -> not *correct* (might miss) but more *efficient*
*** fix by checking if too far & backtracking to recover if so
*** *bug* -> mistake in program/algorithm
** open in middle, see which section, tear down half at a time
*** correct *&* efficient

* think of algorithms on axis between *time to solve prob.* & *size of prob.*
** 3^rd^ -> logarithmic, doesn't take (significantly) longer with more data
*** i.e., cutting progressively in half takes larger bytes out of problem ->
    doubling # *doesn't* double time
* *correctness & well-designedness (efficiency)*
** _take 1 byte, 2 bytes, or half of all bytes out of problem?_

* programming -> translate programs to *pseudocode*
** algorithm implemented in *plain language* -> correct *&* precise
. *pick up* phonebook
. *open to* middle
. *look @* page
. *if* (person on page)
.. *call* person
. *else if* (person earlier in book)
.. *open to* prev. half
.. _rpt._
. *else if* (person later in book)
.. *open to* next half
.. _rpt._
. *else* (e.g., not in book)
.. quit
** often cause of errors -> situations not anticipated
** verbs/actions -> bolded text = functions
** forks/branches -> also bolded (if, else, else if)
** boolean expression = yes/no question to ask (brackets)
*** _1 or 0!!!_
** *loop* -> construct to tell comp. to repeat something (_italic_)

* scratch:
** graphical lang. with same prog. fundamentals (more friendly)
** *then* c -> text/keyboard-based
** function, conditions, bools, loops, vars, threads, events, & more

* https://scratch.mit.edu/[scratch] -> devd. at MIT's media lab
** create proj -> scratch = cat (right)
** sprites -> vis. reps.
** blocks = puzzle pieces (left)
** drag & drop canvas (middle)
** bottom right -> more chars./sprites
** 1^st^ prob. set -> look for ideas
** events cat. -> green flag = go, red sign = stop
** looks -> say = log
** sensing -> prompt *&* wait for answer to store in var.
*** vars. = separate components
** wait block -> can wait for pause
** operations blocks -> language things (join text)
** watch for mental model -> input, algorithm, output
** outputs of 1 func. can be input of next -> repeat the "input -> alg ->
   output" pattern
** control components -> conditionals
*** sensing -> bools
** create counter on click -> custom var.
** scratch animation -> # of changes to animations ovr. time

* build up from something simple -> applicable to all langs./problems/contexts

* diff. sprites can have diff. prgs. -> marco polo games, with 2 talking to
  another
** pass msgs. -> *event broadcasting*
** can use extensions for translation of text

* *abstraction* -> complicated idea simplified for prob. solving
** e.g., create own *block* -> sound of cat
** more readable, self-descriptive, etc.
** don't worry about *implementation detes*

* iterate & build up 1 piece at a time
** break prob. down bit by bit
