== Course Notes

=== Compiling

* `make` = program that *calls* the actual compiler
** course compiler = `clang`
** can call that instead -> `clang hello.c`
*** _notice file extension -> diff. than make_
** by default, outputs `a.out`
** make like `make` -> `clang -o hello hello.c`
*** `-o` = *argument* to program that means *output*
** need arg for external libraries, too -> `-lcs50`
*** i.e., `clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50`
** `make` = automatically do above

* compiling has *4 substeps:*
. preprocessing
*** _take header files & replace with *prototypes* of original code (i.e.,
    header file contents)_
. compiling
*** convert to *assembly language* -> mix of recognizable code from our source
    file & binary-like instructions for computer processor

. assembling
*** *then* translate to binary (called *assembly*) -> machine code that comps.
    processor can run directly
. linking
*** take files from *prototypes* & combine with our code to make *single binary
    file* (`hello`)
** _``make`` makes it easier by taking care of it all for us with 1 cmd._

=== Debugging

* bugs = unintentional behaviour, debugging = *find & fix*
** debugging often helps you see what's going on behind the scenes -> can often
   do with more `printf()` statements to visualize

* use `debug50` -> will help use debugger *built into VSCode*
** steps:
. click to *left of line #* on line of interest to insert a *breakpoint* (i.e.,
  where debugger starts by *pausing code*)
*** hit *play button* to move to next
*** hit *step over* to run through program *line-by-line*
. run `debug50 [filename]` in term.
*** can view *Variables* in the *Run & Debug* window
. step through line-by-line -> don't need to print vars. if viewing in window
. step into -> good if bug isn't var-related, can see which line issue occurs
  on
** *rubber duck* -> explain step-by-step as though to inanimate object

=== Memory

* diff. vars take up diff. memory:
** bool & char (256 ASCII chars) = 1 byte
** float & int (32 bill. vals) = 4 bytes
** double (float * 2) & long (int * 2) = 8 bytes
** string = indetermined (variable-length, short or long)

* random access memory -> bytes stored in "grid squares"
** char = 1 square, int = 4 squares, etc.
** abstracted away so we can build shiiiitttt

=== Arrays

* ints can divide but remainder is thrown away
** divide by decimal to cast implicitly

* arrays = store multiple vals. of same type
** "index into" to assign vals -> `int var[length]` to declare, `var[0] = 5` to
   assign
** *for loops* good -> index already there

{
    int n = get_int("How many scores? ");

    int scores[n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        scores[i] = get_int("Score: ");
    }

    printf("Average: %f\n", (scores[0] + scores[1] + scores[2]) / 3.0);
}
----

=== Characters

* `printf("%c", charVar);` to print chars

* `printf()` can *print chars as ints* -> raw ASCII val.
** or cast to int

* *casting floats to ints loses decimals/other info!!!*

=== Strings

* *arrays* of chars, as defined by CS50's lib.
** `string[0]`, `string[1]`, etc.

* *all strings* in C end with special char to indicate ending -> `\0`
** *null character* or NUL
** 4 bytes needed for string with 3 chars
** fixed-size datatypes (i.e., *other* than strings) don't need the ending char
*** other langs/libs can store custom types with *greater precision* but likely
    implemented by *recording* the # of bytes (i.e., build upon C-style
    datatypes)

* can count # of chars in string:

int main(void)
{
    string name = get_string("Name: ");
    int length = string_length(name);
    printf("%i\n", length);
}
  
int string_length(string s)
{
    int i = 0;
    while (s[i] != '\0')
    {
        i++;
    }
    return i;
}

** don't bother if char is `\0` -> string end
** or use the C `string` lib (`string.h`) `strlen()` func. to count
** CS50 has a https://manual.cs50.io/[manual] for C std lib, C POSIX lib, &
   CS50 lib, too
*** _simpler that std. man. pages_
*** see the https://manual.cs50.io/3/strlen[string length] page in particular
** print each char in string using `strlen`:

    {
        // If lowercase...
        if (s[i] >= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z')
        {
            // ...Convert to uppercase
            printf("%c", s[i] - 32);
        }
        else
        {
            printf("%c", s[i]);
        }

}

*** can convert char. cases by -/+ the 32 bit diff.
** C lib. for string cases -> `ctype.h`
*** use `islower()` to determine case or `toupper()` to convert for you

=== Command-line arguments

* `string argv[]` = arg. *vector* (arr. of args), `int argc` = arg *count*
  (num.)
** e.g., `int main(int argc, string argv[]) { }`
** don't know # of args. before
** `argv[0]` = name of program (i.e., *1^st^ word typed*)
** check to make sure *2 args* before using `argv[1]` (always at least 1)

* `main()` = returns *exit status*
** 0 by default = nothing went wrong
** `return 1;` = indicate error to sys. calling prg.
** `return 0;` = explicit, more readability

=== Applications

* *cryptography* = art of scrambling info. to hide it
** *encrypt* = process of scrambling
** *plaintext* = source
** *key* = 2^nd^ (secret) input required by cipher (number) for scrambling
** *ciphertext* = output after scrambling
** *cipher* = algorithm that does the scrambling
** e.g., `cipher("HI!", 1)` outputs "IJ!" (forward 1)
** e.g., `cipher("UIJT XBT DT50", -1)` outputs "THIS WAS CS50"

== Course Lecture

* `make` = utility to make compiling easier
** on CS50 machines, runs through `clang`
** `a.out` = assembler output, default for `clang`

* command-line args -> additional cmds to mod behaviour of programs

* `make` automatically includes libs
** need to tell `clang` directly -- `-lcs50`, `-lm` for math library, etc.
*** separate process for including headers/libs
** don't have to link `stdio` -> works for free
*** some left out for efficiency reasons, some non-standard

* 4 steps to "compiling":
. preprocess -- imports @ top, getting prototypes in `.h` files ready after
  finding files
. compile -- *real* compiling, convert to assembly language, lowest-level
  before 0s & 1s, & instructs CPUs step-by-step
*** each CPU has own instructions -> partly why Mac software can't run on
    Windows, although can sometimes compile to 2 targets
. assemble -- convert assembly lang to 0s & 1s
. link -- import `.c` files related to `.h` files (i.e., join all the 0s & 1s)
  into output executable

* `a.out` = "assembler output", generic name

* *can* matter order of linking libraries (`make` handles for course tho)

* try to diagnose problem proactively through *debugging*
** look inside vals of vars w/ `printf()`
** debuggers like `debug50 ./[executable]` -> starts VSCode's debugger to walk
   through code step-by-step at comfortable pace
*** step over = continue execution on next line, step into = jump into
    internally called function
** rubber duck -> *talk through* code

* memory of diff. vals
** bools & chars use 1 byte or 4 bits
*** bools technically only need 1 bit but use bytes instead for simplicity
** 4 bytes (32-bits) for ints & floats
** longs & doubles = 8 bytes (64-bits)
** strings = indetermined bits

* to get precise result, need to *cast* ints to floats
** easiest is to add decimal to treat 1 val in equation

* to store multiple of same datatype in C, use *arrays*
** still use same variable name but with `[x]` added when accessing individual
   vals
** eliminate multiple vars, *not* more space-friendly
*** could use char or short to save space but overly-restrictive because
    memory much more available these days

* chars can be *implicitly* cast to ints to show their numeric ASCII values
** "HI!" = 72, 73, 33
** use `printf()` & print as ints instead of chars -> `%i` instead of `%c`

* can use *overt* type casting with (datatype) -> `(int) "A"`

* arrays of chars are *strings*
** can call on vals in string with `var[x]`
** strings = 1 byte per char

* how can comps tell where 1 string ends & another begins?
** distinguish end with *nul* -> special symbol for 8 0 bits (`\0`)
** i.e., all strings end in `\0` with the nul value
** easy to distinguish other datatypes -> predictable lengths/space in memory

* how does `get_string()` work with uncertain # of chars?
** _dynamic memory allocation_ -> grow/shrink array automatically

* some langs make all datatypes variable sizes -> C old so memory & performance
  benefits w/ predictable lengths
** i.e., comps have to *look* at more locations in memory to tell if not preset

* i.e., can tell how much of string you care about by logging length *not*
  including `\0`

* CS50 has https://manual.cs50.io/[man pages] -> std ones aren't that friendly,
  these better

* *don't* need to link libs -> `make` does automatically for course

* higher-level libs can track larger datatypes but often *dynamic* (i.e., see
  how long it is before storing???)

* *remember* answer to question & *store in memory* to reuse
** more efficient -> store `strlen()` in memory instead of calling for each
   iteration
** can declare *2 vars* in for loops, too -> 1 for `i`, other for `strlen()`
   result

* C progs can take command-line args
** reason for typing `int main(void) { }` -> return exit status & accept cli
   args
** `int main(int argc, string argv[]) { }`
** `argc` = count, `argv[]` = array of typed args
** do error handling by checking for args w/ `argc` count
*** *always 1 arg* -> filename being called

* *exit codes* -> `return 1` when something goes wrong (go-to as long as non-0
  exit status)
** ints returned in C -> can be billions of error codes
** when see, generally seeing exit statuses like we're using here
** *can't* loop CLI programs -> returned to parent process & redo
** main *always* returns 0 automatically -> good to explicitly to return 0 when
   no errors

* *readability* problem set -> find vocabulary level of text

* *cryptography* -> scramble to hide contents of msg
** plaintext -> algorithm -> ciphertext
** need to know algorithm used to de-scramble
** cyphers take *multiple args* -> also *key,* which is what cipher algorithm
   uses to rotate/change letters by
*** need to know to decipher consistently
** caesar cipher = + 1
