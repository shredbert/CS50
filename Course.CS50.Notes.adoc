== Lecture 0: Scratch

* prob. solving -> input -> ??? -> output

* how rep. inputs? *info*
** representation -> count with hand? (Unary notation)
** count #s (Decimal digits = base 10)
*** *compose* #s using digit system

* comps. -> not same lang. as ppl
** *simple* = *binary,* 0's & 1's

* base 2 = other nomenclature = bits (binary digits)
** don't use base 10 -> electricity as physical input
** harness elec. & *rep. as info*
*** on/off -> light switch = info
** electricity = track info (store = 1, let go = 0)

* *problem* -> counting higher than 1
** more bulbs -> binary #s, e.g. 3 bulbs = 8 opts., 111 = 7

* *transistors* -> 1's & 0's that comps. have to rep. info
** comps. -> same system as dec. but with bin.
** 10^0^, 10^1^, 10^2^ -> base 10 digits with numerous #'s
** 2^0^, 2^1^, 2^2^, etc. -> base 2
** 110010 bin = 2 + 8 + 16 = 50 dec

* comps. -> started as calculators
** modern = more sophisticated
** how rep. letters? assign letters to unique #'s
** a = 65 = 01000001
** *context* differs for seeing but info same = ascii
*** i.e., defined mapping of letters to #'s
** 72 73 33 = hi! in ascii (asciichart.com)

* getting msg = pattern of bits
** *8-bits* -> moder std. for representing chars
** patterns of 8-bits (8 0's & 1's) = *bytes* (kilo, giga, terra, etc.)

* ascii = only english symbols & punctuation
** 11111111 = max # of chars, 24-bits total
*** 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255 (256 opts.)
** limiting -> bad rep. of human language (accented chars, entire chars in
   other languages)
** *emojis* -> also not covered, implemented as *0's/1's*
** transition from ascii to *unicode* (support all languages)
** face with tears of joy = most pop. emoji, rep.'d as 128514 in dec.
** *way* more than 256 chars

* electricity, #'s, letters, emojis/other langs., *colour/pics*
** how colours rep.'d in comp. -> #'s to diff. colours, agree on mapping
** rgb, hsl, etc. -> map 0's & 1's to diff. colours
** every colours = blend of #'s
** e.g., 72 73 33 bits in rgb = yellow (emoji colour)
*** _context-specific_
** pixels -> core building blocks of displays, images composed of lots of dots
   (pxs.), each using 24-bits (3 bytes)
*** why binary files so large -> tons of combinations

* comps. rep. vids. similarly -> series of stored images, changing many times
  per second
** _flip book_
** music -> could rep. in diff. ways, nums.? (notes, durations, etc.)
*** music can be quantized -> just need to *agree*
** diff. file formats -> rep. *agreed patterns* of 0's & 1's so can be
   displayed consistently
** all 0's & 1's

* rep. inputs *consistently* to solve probs. & get outputs (conv. to
  solutions)
** nums, chars, imgs., vids., sound
** algorithms = step-by-step instructions for *solving problems*
*** i.e., *recipe* or *instructions* with *no ambiguity* (comps.)
*** _inputs -> algorithms -> outputs_
** *correct & precise* -> comps. take literally
** *translate* algorithm into lang. comp. understands
*** ensure comp. *doesn't* misinterpret

* algorithm -> contacts app
** store alphabetically
** old-school -> phonebook
** look through 1 page @ a time -> *correct,* not *efficient*
*** skipping pgs. -> not *correct* (might miss) but more *efficient*
*** fix by checking if too far & backtracking to recover if so
*** *bug* -> mistake in program/algorithm
** open in middle, see which section, tear down half at a time
*** correct *&* efficient

* think of algorithms on axis between *time to solve prob.* & *size of prob.*
** 3^rd^ -> logarithmic, doesn't take (significantly) longer with more data
*** i.e., cutting progressively in half takes larger bytes out of problem ->
    doubling # *doesn't* double time
* *correctness & well-designedness (efficiency)*
** _take 1 byte, 2 bytes, or half of all bytes out of problem?_

* programming -> translate programs to *pseudocode*
** algorithm implemented in *plain language* -> correct *&* precise
. *pick up* phonebook
. *open to* middle
. *look @* page
. *if* (person on page)
.. *call* person
. *else if* (person earlier in book)
.. *open to* prev. half
.. _rpt._
. *else if* (person later in book)
.. *open to* next half
.. _rpt._
. *else* (e.g., not in book)
.. quit
** often cause of errors -> situations not anticipated
** verbs/actions -> bolded text = functions
** forks/branches -> also bolded (if, else, else if)
** boolean expression = yes/no question to ask (brackets)
*** _1 or 0!!!_
** *loop* -> construct to tell comp. to repeat something (_italic_)

* scratch:
** graphical lang. with same prog. fundamentals (more friendly)
** *then* c -> text/keyboard-based
** function, conditions, bools, loops, vars, threads, events, & more
+
[source, c]

#include <stdio.h>

* https://scratch.mit.edu/[scratch] -> devd. at mit's media lab
** create proj -> scratch = cat (right)
** sprites -> vis. reps.
** blocks = puzzle pieces (left)
** drag & drop canvas (middle)
** bottom right -> more chars./sprites
** 1^st^ prob. set -> look for ideas
** events cat. -> green flag = go, red sign = stop
** looks -> say = log
** sensing -> prompt *&* wait for answer to store in var.
*** vars. = separate components
** wait block -> can wait for pause
** operations blocks -> language things (join text)
** watch for mental model -> input, algorithm, output
** outputs of 1 func. can be input of next -> repeat the "input -> alg ->
   output" pattern
** control components -> conditionals
*** sensing -> bools
** create counter on click -> custom var.
** scratch animation -> # of changes to animations ovr. time

* build up from something simple -> applicable to all langs./problems/contexts

* diff. sprites can have diff. prgs. -> marco polo games, with 2 talking to
  another
** pass msgs. -> *event broadcasting*
** can use extensions for translation of text

* *abstraction* -> complicated idea simplified for prob. solving
** e.g., create own *block* -> sound of cat
** more readable, self-descriptive, etc.
** don't worry about *implementation detes*

* iterate & build up 1 piece at a time
** break prob. down bit by bit

=== Problem Set

https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/0/scratch/[Scratch problem]

== Lecture 1: C

View the https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/1/[lecture website].

* programming in C = same ideas as Scratch, just *text-based*
** i.e., *pseudo-code* identical for all problems being solved, just the
   *format for telling the computer how to do it* that changes

* 3 principles for *writing code well:*
. *correctness* (work as intended)
. *design* (subjective, well-written)
** like essays (correct args, poor writing)
. *style* (aesthetic, like good punctuation, caps, indents, etc.)
** don't change *correctness* when improving other 

* CS50 IDE
** IDE = integrated dev environment, env. for programming
** ide.cs50.io -> course-specific, browser-based
** terminal & text editor
*** term = commands

* text editor (edit code) + terminal window (run cmds)
** cloud-based -> ensures everyone has same exp.

* env. requires *CLI*
** not *GUI*
** term = blinking prompt

* *code* understood by humans, *computers* understand binary (1s & 0s)
** comps. can print on screen -> pattern of 0s & 1s
** take source code & convert it to 0s & 1s that comps. understand using a
   *compiler*
** compiler = intermediary program -> cnvrt. src. to machine code
** *make* -> compiler
*** *no* file extension
** run with ./hello -> no extension, bin. output has none
*** "$" -> *prompt* (where commands are typed)

* funcs. & args.
** mini-program -> action/verb
*** "say", "wait", etc.
** inputs = args. (or parameters)
** say something in say = printf()
*** printf = print *formatted*
** Scratch -> white ovals *mimic brackets*
** need semicolon, quotes, brackets, etc.
*** many lines of code need to end with semicolon

* same *paradigm* as scratch
** functions = programmed version of algorithm (implemented in code)

* *programs do 2 things:* takes inputs (args.) & can have *side effects*
*** often *visual* (text/audio)
** return vals./variables -> functions hand back vals. (don't show/say)
*** use output in program
** Scratch -> say block has immediate vis. effect, ask block tucks away stuff
   in var.
** `get_string()` -> from *CS50 library*
*** lib. = code others wrote

* string = *text*
** `get_string("[prompt]")` -> func. with input

* have to *assign* to vars
** e.g., `string answer = get_string("what's your name?");`
*** `=` is *assignment* operator
*** need to tell comp. what *type* of var, too
** `[type] [name] = get_string("[prompt]");`

* forgetting "grammar" makes code *frustrating & not interesting,*
  pedantic/aesthetic
** good style/grammar comes with *practice* (like writing other langs.)

* can then *do something* with return val.
** side effects = happen to you, return val. = info stored so you can use it
** do in C -> `printf("hello, %s", answer);`
*** `%s` = format code, printf() does formatting on placeholders (string in
    this case)
*** commas (outside of quotes) = separate args. to functions (ignore comma *in
    string*)

* more verbose = more readable (e.g., "answer" instead of just "a")
** math doesn't *need* to be semantic -> no style

* C = older, have to recompile every time
** now have fancier envs. where compiles automatically (code.org, codecademy)

* have to *tell* comp. to break line
** i.e., move cursor to next line
** `\[char]` = *escape character*, `\n` = new line

* don't have to *call* get_string(), assigning to var. calls func.
** `=` tells comp. to execute RH & *then* store, spreading 2 ops. in 1

* CS50 lib. -> allows same logic as scratch (`get_string`)

* Boilerplate -- needed to start writing
+
----
int main(void)
{

}
----

* Header files -> end with `.h`
** `#include <stdio.h>` -> very pop. file in C that gets input/output
*** e.g., `printf()`
** access *more functions* than defaults
** header files = *extensions in Scratch* (fancy buried features)

* many ways to screw up prgs.
** top of output usually gives name of file & where
** *help50* -> prog., helps to make sense of cryptic output in term. by
   translating
** `make hello` = `help50 make hello`

* ugly = bad *style*, hard to read
** no errors with bad style -> use `style50` prg.
** use comments -> good style
*** ensure *semantic* -> purpose of code, not code itself

* `check50` -> tool for labs/assignments to check *correctness* of code
** automated tests from staff
** enter `check50 cs50/problems/hello` -> prompts GitHub auth.
** red = errors, yellow = couldn't run test cus prev. failed, green = tests
   pass

* CS50 IDE = own *server* in cloud

* binary files in text editors -> machine lang., users can't see
** 0s & 1s technically *misinterpreted* in ASCII chars. within *text editor*
** i.e., machine code misinterpreted as text
** open *source,* not *program*

* term. cmds:
** `ls` -> list files in current directory
*** bash green w/ asterisk = executable
** `rm` -> remove (`rm -rf` for directories with files)
*** `y` or `n` at prompt for yes/no
** `mv` -> rename/move
** `mkdir` -> make dir.
** `cd` -> move to dir.
** `~` -> tilde = *home* directory
** `..` -> prev. dir.
** `./` -> current dir.
*** run files with `./[filename]`
** `pwd` -> print the current dir.
** `rmdir` -> remove dir.
** `cp` -> copy

* `make` = makes *easier* to compile but not *technically* a compiler

* data types -> lots in C
** *type* of val. to store
** also many *funcs.* for CS50 that help you get diff. data types
** some types have *finite bits* -> ints, floats, chars, doubles, longs,
   strings, etc.
*** int = 32 bits, \~4 billion
*** long = 64 bits, twice as many vals.
** `printf()` -> diff. format codes, %c (char), %f (float w/ dec), %i (int), %li
   (long int), %s (string)
** *operators* -> +, -, * , /, % 
*** all math stuff -> early nerds

* CS50's `get_int()` -> will reject vals. based on invalid input, like 3 & 4
  bill.
** 2 bill. max (4 bill. *total* but includes *negatives*)

* *float* for decimals -> most division ops.
** *however,* if other vars are ints, won't work (rounds)
** *lose* decimals -> math done on *ints,* no matter what the result is stored
   as
** could change all to floats
** *OR* convert ints to floats -> *casting*
*** `float z = (float) x / (float) y`
*** new datatype in parens. = *casting*

* `=` is assignment operator, RH side 1^st^
** `counter = counter + 1`
** *OR* `counter += 1;` or `counter++;` -> *syntactic sugar*

* conditions:
+
----
if ([condition])
{
    [logic]
}
else if ([other condition])
{
    [other logic]
}
else
{
    [other other logic]
}
----
+
** try to *be succinct* -> just use else at end to reduce typing

* equality = `x == y`, less than = `x < y`, greater than = `x > y`

* use *single quotes* when comparing individual characters (*chars*)
** string = `""`, char = `''`
** use `||` for multiple options (`if ([cond1] || [cond2])`)

* looping -> `for()` = specific # of times, `while()` = until condition true
+
----
// while loops -- check condition *then* do something
int i = 0 // "i" = int, short
while (i < 50)
{
    printf("hey!!!\n");
    i++;
}

// do while -- do 1 thing *before* checking condition
do
{
    printf("hey!!!\n");
}
while (i < 50);

// for loops -- concise when doing something a certain # of times
for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) // unique to for loop -> multiple statements/semi-colons in brackets
{
    printf("hey!!!\n");
}
----

* abstraction = *simplify* complicated detes underneath
** use *functions* to hide complex code
** custom funcs. usually at *bottom* (main/entry point at top)
** *errors* -> compiler doesn't know where func. is
*** can put *title* at top to tell compiler it *will* exist (`void meow(void);`
    with actual func. at bottom)

* some lines *don't* need semicolons -> function names, for loops, if
  statements, etc.
** *convention* -> finish most constructs with thought, others decided it
   didn't need

* *C99* -> 1999 version of C

* functions -> 1^st^ = rtrn. val. & parens -> *args.*
** `void meow(int n)` = no output, `n` input
** `return` statement -> send value back from func.

* *scope* -> if want var. outside of curly braces, need it *declared* outside
** i.e., lines of code where a var. exists
** *match the braces!!!*
** *don't* need vals just to declare

* what computers *can't* do:
** *finite memory* -> limitation
** `printf()` can print out to lots of digits
*** `printf("%.10f\n", 1 / 10);`
** with lots of decimal places, *incorrect result*
** *memory* issue -> if using finite bits, can count *infinitely
   high/precisely*
*** i.e., *approximates* at some point
*** big deal for math/finance -> imprecision == bad
*** issues with floats *&* ints
*** like y2k
*** will happen in *2038* again -> no more bits to keep track of time, 32-bit
    #s counting seconds from Jan. 1^st^, 1970
*** _4 billionth second will be hit_

=== Compiling

* `make` = program that *calls* the actual compiler
** course compiler = `clang`
** can call that instead -> `clang hello.c`
*** _notice file extension -> diff. than make_
** by default, outputs `a.out`
** make like `make` -> `clang -o hello hello.c`
*** `-o` = *argument* to program that means *output*
** need arg for external libraries, too -> `-lcs50`
*** i.e., `clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50`
** `make` = automatically do above

* compiling has *4 substeps:*
. preprocessing
*** _take header files & replace with *prototypes* of original code (i.e.,
    header file contents)_
. compiling
*** convert to *assembly language* -> mix of recognizable from our code &
    binary-like instructions for computer processor

. assembling
*** *then* translate to binary (called *assembly*) -> machine code that comps.
    processor can run directly
. linking
*** take files from *link* step (above) & combine with our code to make *single
    binary file* (`hello`)
** _`make` makes it easier by taking care of it all for us with 1 cmd._

=== Debugging

* bugs = unintentional behaviour, debugging = *find & fix*
** debugging often helps you see what's going on behind the scenes -> can often
   do with more `printf()` statements to visualize

* use `debug50` -> will help use debugger *built into VSCode*
** steps:
. click to *left of line #* on line of interest to insert a *breakpoint* (i.e.,
  where debugger starts by *pausing code*)
*** hit *play button* to move to next
*** hit *step over* to run through program *line-by-line*
. run `debug50 [filename]` in term.
*** can view *Variables* in the *Run & Debug* window
. step through line-by-line -> don't need to print vars. if viewing in window
