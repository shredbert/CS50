Display start screen -- player presses space to begin.

Make a simple pong-like game -- player is a shredder, goals are listeners, bots
are classical musicians.

Player gets wider area (guitar) but bots become more numerous.

Each round is 30 seconds -- track score of shredder & score of other team.

Play 5 rounds -- each round increase the # of bots.

Display score of each team & timer for each round throughout match.
