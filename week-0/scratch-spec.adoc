== Spec

Player is an electric guitar being attacked by acoustic guitars ("Grampas
guitars"). Player must shred (i.e., shoot lightning bolts) at the enemies to
accumulate points. Every new point makes both the player guitar & the Grampas
guitars faster, thereby increasing difficulty. The goal is to last as long as
possible in the face of old person music.
