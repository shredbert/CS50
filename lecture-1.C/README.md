# Lecture 1: C

- same ideas as Scratch, just text-based

- how to write (& well)? guides:
    - correctness (work as intended)
    - design (subjective, well-written)
        - like essays (correct args, poor writing)
    - style (aesthetic, like good punctuation, caps, indents, etc.)
        - don't change *correctness*
